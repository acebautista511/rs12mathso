                        x/y always the same holds true with the ratio y/x. (Licuanan, P., 2016)</strong></p>
                        <p class="features-tittle"></p>
                        <p class="features-text"><strong>Example: </strong>
                            State whether X and Y are directly proportional or not in the following table:

                            We have 3/9= 3/9 ÷3/3 = 1/3
                            Since each of the ratios of the corresponding values of X and Y is a constant equal to 1/3, X and Y are directly proportional.

                   <p class="features-tittle"></p>

                            State whether X and Y are inversely proportional or not in the following table:

                            We know that if X and Y vary inversely, then the product (X, Y) remains the same for all the values of X and Y. Here, 8 X 32 = 256, 16 X 16 = 256, 32 X 8 = 256, 4 X 64 = 256 and 256 X 1 = 256. Clearly, the products of all the values of X and Y are the same, that is, 256. 
                            Therefore, X and Y vary inversely.</p>

                            For example, a father wants to leave P467,500 to his four children in the ratio of 1 : 3 : 3 : 4, so the first child will receive 
                            1/11 of P467,500; the second child will receive 3/11 of P467, 500; the third child will receive 3/11 of P467,500 and the fourth child will receive 4/11 of P467, 500.</p>
